      "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nin cases where mDNS is not available, e.g. constrained router bootstrap, an alternative input method would be useful.\r\nI see no reason why this could not be done within the hosts' resolver stack.\r\nBy using a pseudo-domain, e.g. `ll-ip6.arpa` and composing the name by concatenating address in rfc5952 format with dashes prepended by the local interface name.\r\nSo `fe80::23:42` on `en5` becomes `en5.fe80--23-42.ll-ip6.arpa`.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this representation is that it does not need any change to the client application (assuming it uses the OS's resolver and the scope id in sockaddr_in6 is not bleached) and plays well with the same-origin policy. \r\n\r\nFrom a web app/server perspective, it is the same as answering to all names of a wildcard DNS record.\r\n\r\nInterest for a PR proposing that?",
